# Minesweeper-for-PC
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

NOTATIONS used in the game ->
Closed Box = â¬›
Flag = ðŸš©
Opened Box = â¬œ
Mine = ðŸ’£

HOW TO PLAY- 

0) Click Start button to start the game.(will clear the map and place numbers on the grid)

1) Review the numbers. Any NUMBER on the board refers to the no. of mines (ðŸ’£) currently touching that NUMBER's box (â¬›).

2) Right-click boxes that you think contain mines. This will put a flag (ðŸš©) on the box. 
It's best to start with boxes that absolutely have to contain mines(e.g., a solitary box next to a "1" on the board), to help with the process of elimination later. 
Note that the number of flags available for a particular grid is equal to the number of mines present in the same.

3) Clear the board. To win a round of Minesweeper, you must open (â¬œ) every closed box that doesn't have a mine under it. Once you've done so, the game will be over.
If you accidentally click a box that has a mine beneath it, the game will be over.
