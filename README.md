## Highlights

✅ Engineered a 2K+ lines of code production-ready desktop game app based on [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) (a logic puzzle video game), built entirely from the ground up using Python, [Tkinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter) (Python's standard GUI), and SQLite.

✅ Built a fully custom game engine implementing core mechanics — including randomized mine placement, recursive [flood-fill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) for tile reveals, and real-time win/loss evaluation — no external game libraries or engines used.

✅ Developed a wide array of features — including secure best-time records with custom anti-cheat mechanism, difficulty modes, a custom game variant to minimize [guess-situations](https://minesweeper.fandom.com/wiki/Forced_Guess), color theming and grid transition animations for enhanced UI, and customizable background music and in-app feedback option for improved UX.

✅ Designed and integrated a 300+ line fully automatic in-app update system — since the app is distributed via GitHub.



## Description

[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) is a classic puzzle game once bundled with Windows — iconic for its logic-based tile revealing gameplay. Many remember the nostalgic Windows 7 version:

It was removed with Windows 8.
